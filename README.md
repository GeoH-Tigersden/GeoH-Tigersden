- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project managment app that is capable of working for multiple industries and different levels of users,
- a to do list that intergrates with other programs to generate an entire life organising system.
- interaction with multiple online and intranet (not internet) databases
- cloud drives and company networks for documents and video's
